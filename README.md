Mr. George Soros starts a new business venture of opening a chain of specialty Hungarian eateries in California. However, he does not have sufficient capital to start his plan. In order to collect sufficient capital, he plans to invest in a high return, diverse, and low risk portfolio of stocks for a year. Mr. Solos has approached our team to do an analysis to find out an optimal investment portfolio and meet the requirements at the same time.

●	At most 40% of his total investment capital to be in each industry 

●	Average weighted profit margin must exceed 20%, Average weighted Beta must less than 1.2, Average weighted PEG ratio must less than 1.4

●	At most %50,000 investment in Clorox, Equinix and Signature Bank 

The goals of the portfolios are to find out:

●	Maximize Expected Return Next Year

●	Minimize Average Weighted Beta
